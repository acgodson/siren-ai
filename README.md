### How It Works

| Feature                                        | Description                                                                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ZK Proofs and Anonymous Ride Reporting**     | Claim on-chain points for siren contributions while keeping ride information private and verifiable.                                 |
| **Greenfield and Decentralized Data Storage**  | Noise-map index, along with AI context and conversation histories, are stored on BNB Greenfield for distributed access.  |
| **Gasless Operations and User Actions**        | In-app account abstraction wallets enable cost-free claims and reporting for contributors, ensuring a seamless experience.          |

This version removes extra line breaks, improves clarity, and provides more consistent wording for the feature descriptions.
